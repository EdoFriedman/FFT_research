# Fourier Analysis

[Hi Oren, we would really appreciate if you check out this fascinating video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### Goal

- Our master goal is to improve the fft analysis and decrease its running time by changing the parameters while the code is running, after this we'll conclude which parameters are best for each situations, the parameters contain
  - **window size**: size of window to do fft on.
  - **window overlapping**: percentage of overlapping between windows.
  - **norm change (alpha)**: acceptable amount of change between windows to call them similar.
  - **heavy coefficient (gamma)**: acceptable amount of influence over the overall function.
  - **flatten**: determine how much amplitude is accepted as an important point.
- Find what are the applications of our research on the real world, the tweaking of the parameters can give us a better understanding of the types and variety of sounds which include
  - find human's speaking best frequencies.
  - find musical instruments best frequencies.
  - find general object's best frequencies.
