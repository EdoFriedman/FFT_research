# Fourier Analysis

[Hi Oren, we would really appreciate if you check out this fascinating video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

###Goal

- Our master goal is to improve the fft analysis and decrease its running time by changing the parameters while the code is running, after this we'll conclude which parameters are best for each situations.
- Find what are the applications of our research on the real world, the tweaking of the parameters can give us a better understanding of the types and variety of sounds which include
  - find human's speaking best frequencies.
  - find musical instruments best frequencies.
  - find general object's best frequencies.
